# Overconsumption, Shein, and AI

<Blockquote author="Fyodor Dostoevsky">
  The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he's in prison.
</Blockquote>

Karl Marx is an extremely polarising figure even today, over 150 years after his death. On one hand, he is revered as a revolutionary thinker and the father of communist ideology; on the other, he is considered a dangerous radical, often cited as a threat to modern liberalism and democracy. Most recently, Dubai Chocolate — the latest manifestation of consumerism and capitalism — has been used to mock him online. And though these memes may be funny, history seems to be on Marx's side in some aspects. If we analyse something as simple as the history of consumerism, we can slowly start to hear the laughter of Marx from his grave.

## From Workers to Consumers: A Brief History

To explain this, we must first look at the history of consumerism. Post-WWII, despite many western countries' claims to oppose Marx and his teachings, a series of socialist policies were put in place that prioritised the working class: cheap housing and education, well-paying jobs, policies focused on helping the general public, and a 90% corporate tax — leading to most profits made by companies being reinvested back into the people. While there is an obvious exclusion of people of colour and women, the people these systems were built around were, by their own metrics, extremely successful long term.

This system continued for a few decades and, through civil-rights protests, the inequality within race and gender saw a slow progressive slope. As workers, political organisation was important to demand reforms, drive change, and keep the government in check. This is part of what Marx envisioned.

This all changed in an event known as the **Revolt of the Elite**.

As President Ronald Reagan took charge in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK, the two elites who now ran their respective countries did so with their elite sentiments in mind. The great problem with socialist reforms was that they were creating a society which was too egalitarian — too equal. The elite do not just operate on concepts of more wealth but also on the fundamental idea of supremacy.

> Equality feels like a threat to those used to privilege.

In response to this threat, the elite cut education and made policies that profited off the amenities the government once provided unquestionably. Most importantly, Reagan and Thatcher made one pivotal change that brought on the modern age: **the people stopped being defined as workers and became consumers.**

## "I Buy, Therefore I Am"

This change spiralled into the current situation we have today. Services were replaced by goods and, in the name of *innovation*, we were sold products to buy for every whim and every need. The question became not about how much you could grow, but how much you could consume.

Flash-forwarding to the modern day, we see the result clearly. We buy things we don't need, with money we don't have, to impress people we don't like, and create an identity we don't know. Consumerism is a competition to gain prestige through material goods. We have, in some ways, become slaves to aesthetics as we hop onto each new trend, trying to outdo each other.

There has been a loss of unity amongst the working class — each person trying to out-do the other, seeing their peers as competition rather than community, led by the atmosphere promoted by consumerism. If you are not consuming, you are seen as behind on trends and old-fashioned.

This is most obvious in how we grant aesthetics like the *"clean girl"*, *"old money"*, *"downtown girl"*, or *"skater boy"* to people based purely on their appearance. While aesthetics alone aren't harmful — it's not problematic to dress in ways you find appealing — when we start making assumptions about entire groups based on appearance, and when we abandon our own genuine likes and dislikes in the pursuit of a societal image, we cheapen our relationships with ourselves and the people around us.

More importantly, when we are stuck competing amongst ourselves, **we fail to hold those in power accountable.**

## The Cost We Refuse to See

American Eagle released an ad starring Sydney Sweeney that supported eugenics and spoke of the superiority of certain genes over others. The company never faced repercussions. Dolce and Gabbana, in a recent fashion show, built their theme around the *ideal male* with no men of colour — and were similarly left unanswered. Our desire for the goods these companies provide has left us too shallow to perceive the very real danger and injustice they help accelerate.

A lot of the current markets — especially those related to beauty, skincare, and fashion — are built on the consumer's **dissatisfaction**. By narrowing the societal view of concepts like beauty, which are inherently subjective and not for corporations to define, they manage to convince the consumer that there is something inherently wrong with them. Social media operates in the same manner, giving rise to communities like *looksmaxxing* which often carry neo-Nazi ideals and hide advertising in their content.

Brands like Shein have been linked to child labour, human exploitation, and trafficking — left largely unaddressed simply because of how profitable the model is.

Francis Fukuyama, an American political scientist, wrote of how he predicted that consumerism would be the end of history — that the indulgence it creates and the division of the working class would produce a subservient populace beneath an authoritarian government. Professor Jeung Xueqin builds on this pointedly:

<Blockquote author="Prof. Jeung Xueqin">
  Consumerism is the perfection of slavery.
</Blockquote>

On a more literal level, the debt created by purchasing all the goods we could ever want will hang over our heads until it's paid off. Financial jeopardy is the easiest way to lose your autonomy in the modern world. If everything is privatised and the interests of people are never considered in business decisions, we may be entering what some political theorists call **modern-day feudalism**.

## AI and the Environmental Reckoning

With AI entering the market and making buying easier than ever, the other end of the problem becomes visible. If everyone is absorbed in aesthetics, the important roles of order, justice, and equality are left forgotten. AI platforms like ChatGPT are aimed at being maximally convenient and maximally isolating — replacing human connection and community with an option that simply agrees with everything we say.

And the environmental cost is staggering:

- Globally, AI-related infrastructure may soon **consume six times more water than Denmark** — a country of 6 million — according to one estimate. A quarter of humanity already lacks access to clean water and sanitation.
- A single request made through ChatGPT **consumes 10 times the electricity of a Google Search**, reported the International Energy Agency.
- Nationally, industrial water use accounts for **15.9 billion gallons** of daily water withdrawals — nearly 4% of total usage — while less than 1% of Earth's water sources are accessible for human use at all. Water is a resource that **663 million people** cannot access.
- Material extraction, greatly accelerated by the resources needed for AI infrastructure like gold and silicon, is responsible for **80% of total biodiversity loss**.
- Since the late 18th century, the ocean has absorbed approximately **30% of all carbon emissions generated by humans** — and is now responsible for dying reefs crucial to fighting climate change.
- A generative AI training cluster may consume **seven or eight times more energy** than a typical computing workload, according to MIT's Noman Bashir, a Computing and Climate Impact Fellow. As models grow larger and more complex, these demands will only increase.

These statistics are not meant to baffle or create anxiety. They are a wake-up call. **Apathy is not a choice.**

## What We Actually Control

We have been able to find ways to preserve coral reefs. AI has been used to map ocean pollution. There are paths forward. But for the sake of pretty things and comfort, we cannot afford to give up our rights or allow injustice to continue unchallenged.

In *The Great Gatsby*, F. Scott Fitzgerald directly warns readers of the emptiness at the heart of materialism — that the hollowness we feel cannot be filled by superficial wants.

This is a problem over which we have a surprisingly high amount of control, because the entire issue is directly tied to our spending habits. There is nothing wrong with investing in what we like. But mindfulness about where a product comes from, the ethics of the company, and local alternatives are always better options.

More importantly — in an age where insecurities are pried upon — perhaps the biggest issue is how we look at ourselves in the mirror. Consumerism stems from anxiety, unfulfilledness, and insecurity. The beauty standards we live under are unfair, and the more we are detached from the real world, the more we fall victim to them.

Spending a lifetime hating yourself so that some billionaire's pockets may be lined is, when phrased that way, a fairly ridiculous way to live. For a large majority of our perceived flaws, we eventually learn they were never things to hate in the first place. It is entirely possible to skip the self-hatred stage and arrive at the same awareness: **our looks were never the problem. Our perception of them, though — that was.**
