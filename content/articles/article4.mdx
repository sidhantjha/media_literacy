# The Hauntings of the Humanities

<Blockquote author="Dead Poets Society">
  Medicine, law, business, engineering — these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love — these are what we stay alive for.
</Blockquote>

Aristotle and Jean-Jacques Rousseau are names hung up in the halls of history for their intellectual contributions, specifically to the fields of politics and philosophy. These great thinkers have been adored centuries after their deaths and considered with great pride in the Western world. Yet, the fields they pursued — which gave them such prestige — have been in a process of aggressive decline for the last 150 years. These fields are now considered unnecessary, unproductive, and not a good *"return on investment."*

This essay answers why that happened: the context it occurred in, the thinking behind it, and the impact it has had over time.

## The Downfall Began From Within

The decline of the humanities began inside of them. **Postmodernism**, which originated as a form of literary critique, is a philosophy completely antithetical to the worldview that initially gave rise to the humanities. By attacking the objective truths of universal reason and the existence of a *shared humanity*, it reduced all truth to interpretation — politicizing academic inquiry and shifting the ground from reason to power. The validity of ideas no longer matters as much as who wields them. Rationality has lost its authority, and with it, the ability to distinguish between meaningful artistic work and superficial creation.

What postmodernism fails to acknowledge is its own internal contradiction: if all opinions are equal, then the belief that *not* all opinions are equal must be given equal weight.

Alongside postmodernism, **nihilism** further eroded the authority of reason. As Nietzsche defined it, the subordination of reason to will is the event in which the highest values are devalued and reduced to the status of ideology. The humanities play a crucial role in orienting people toward good and nuance. Their devaluation has led to a culture that undermines basic morality and holds a dangerously linear view of how the world came to be.

## The History We Were Told and the History That Was

The popular understanding of civilizational progress has been muddled and falsely stated.

Rome is a beloved of the modern imagination — the invisible muse that haunts our minds as trends like *"how often do you think about the Roman Empire"* resurface in popular culture. It is referenced as the height of civilizational organization, praised for its attempted democracy and the anecdotes of Julius Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, and Scipio Africanus. Yet we fail to remember that even at its height, **35–40% of the Roman population were enslaved**. Its brief experiment with democracy extended the vote to only a small portion of people, and those votes were not considered equal. Rome was, for most of its history, an authoritarian power. Emperors like Nero complicate any simple narrative of its *glory*.

Furthermore, the idea that humanity has only progressed since the Enlightenment is not just popular — it is largely a lie. While medical, philosophical, and scientific discoveries certainly laid the groundwork for real progress, not all of that progress was good. Concepts of **social Darwinism, imperialism, and colonisation** emerged, leading to eugenics and genocide justified through propaganda like the *"White Man's Burden."* The glory of Rome was used to justify new empires — British and Belgian — both responsible for some of the worst atrocities humanity has ever seen, built upon the exploitation of India, China, and the Congo.

These systems went unchallenged because the humanities were treated superficially — leaving a void where the crucial questions that challenge power and bring upon change once existed.

## Anti-Intellectualism and the Scientific Overreach

Anti-intellectualism has been a driving blow to the humanities. The **Scientific Revolution** was a remarkable event, without which our current society could not exist. But it brought with it a devastating assumption: that everything observable by the physical senses is real, and anything that cannot be physically observed is dispensable.

With the cult-like following the revolution attracted, this assumption went largely unquestioned. The natural sciences came to claim possession of the *whole truth*, in all and any capacity. Interpretation was limited. The idea that complete intellectual development could come purely through the natural sciences — what would eventually evolve into STEM — originated here.

The consequences are visible. **Anthropology**, the *scientific* study of humans, was meant to evolve our understanding of the human race. Instead it produced an almost primitive framework: studying skull sizes, jaw sizes, and body proportions to affirm concepts of racial and gender hierarchy — not even upholding the standards of objective discovery the scientific method was supposed to promote.

The **Second Industrial Revolution** in America, led by tycoons like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Ford, saw the pursuit of efficiency reach its highest level. They produced unprecedented wealth but did so at the cost of the environment, of craft, and of their workers — 18-hour days in lethal conditions, workers without status or leverage, maimed by dangerous machinery. Before labour unions gained any power, propaganda rooted in social Darwinism and *"pulling up your bootstraps"* justified the system. The phrase was designed to ensure labour was performed without questioning where it came from — enslavement in the name of efficiency.

## Reagan and the Capitalization of the University

The crisis finally hit the humanities directly when **Ronald Reagan** began the dangerous trend of treating universities as a business and political tool. Amputating sociology, English, history, philosophy, the classics, and even art and music — always in the name of *"economizing"* — has been a theme of politicians ever since, claiming simply to be applying business principles to higher education.

In 2008, Indiana State University became among the first schools to undertake a comprehensive review of its offerings, which resulted in the **elimination or suspension of 48 academic programs**, including art history, German, and journalism. A University of North Carolina board member, after eliminating 46 degree programs, stated plainly:

> "We're capitalists, and we have to look at what the demand is, and we have to respond to the demand."

This reflects a larger theme: education no longer exists to educate, but to prepare people for employment. Its impact on society has been profound — particularly in the United States.

Technological creation for the sake of creation now summarizes the majority of the current internet. There has been no consideration of consequence, and it has led to widespread crises: teenage suicide, radicalization, a loneliness epidemic, and now generative AI.

## AI and the Price of Progress Without Wisdom

AI was built on the promise of helping humanity — not profiting from it. Better jobs, fewer filler tasks, more meaningful research. But when a capitalistic system built upon exploitation saw an opportunity to make more money, it took it. The result has been **mass unemployment**, a crashing economy, the rise of authoritarianism, and the mass spread of misinformation. AI has been used to seize the arts — humanity's most sacred tool for meaning, hope, and connection — and exploit them.

The humanities warned of this. Specifically, the departments of universities that have been systematically defunded spent decades warning of authoritarianism, of dystopias with surveillance, of inequality built on gender and identity and race, of worlds where the real and the not-real can no longer be distinguished. Where STEM brings innovation, the humanities help that innovation be implemented with wisdom. Their separation has led not just to inefficiency, but to genuine human harm.

> Technological innovation without an understanding of the humanities is precisely why we have generative AI — progress for the sake of progress. Just as we once had the nuclear bomb.

## A Resurgence

And yet — in moments of despair, we see adaptation. There is hope.

The humanities have seen a **resurgence since the arrival of AI in 2022**. Some universities, like UC Berkeley, saw a 73% rise in humanities-related enrolment. In the advent of global wars and general instability, the humanities have resurfaced as the voice of reason amid the chaos of unchecked *progress* and *efficiency*.

Class consciousness is rising. Boycotting billionaires — the face of uncontrolled greed — has resurfaced. There is a powerful refusal to be dehumanized, and more people are reading with urgency than in generations. The society we live in is being questioned. The loss of community and the rise of hyper-individualism is being recognised as both unrealistic and unstable. As history rhymes with the industrial revolution that preceded it, the labour unions that rose before may be slowly rising again. AI is no longer universally appreciated — it is beginning to be detested.

The words of Aristotle and Rousseau echo in our minds as we choose the kind of change we want. In an era where rationality was underplayed, it is now returning — amidst the loss of our understanding of what is real.

**The voice of the humanities, quietened over generations, is ready to be heard. And we must listen — and doubt, and question, and learn. Just as we always have.**
