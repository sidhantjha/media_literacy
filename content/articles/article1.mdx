This is not a prophecy. It is not an opinion. It is an observation of the economic trends that we are all seeing extremely often. It is an analysis of why the poor get poorer and the rich richer; why your iced matcha latte is $11 and why employment is now an accomplishment.

And most importantly, what role does AI have in all this?

More than you think — that’s for sure.

## The AI Bubble

The word “AI Bubble” has been floating around the internet for quite a bit, and it’s a topic which is both infamous and complicated. To get to a point where all the pieces can finally be put together and create the final picture, we have to go back to the basics.

## What is a Financial Bubble?

Stanford GSB’s Peter Koudijs says a bubble is “where investors buy an asset not for its fundamental value, but because they plan to resell, at a higher price, to the next investor.”

Or to put it differently, an asset or industry that is overestimated, where its value is based on its potential, not its actual current value.

With that definition established, it’s time to take a look at the many angles that contribute to the current state of the AI industry.

## The Potential

Trillions have been invested into AI and on paper, it’s a promising development. A technology that is smarter, faster and more efficient than any human being means a new layer of possibilities. It brought with it a new Pandora’s Box of predictions. Some of AI being better personal assistants; others, more ambitious visions of profit growing in every possible industry as AI replaces human labour — preventing the payment of employees and increasing a huge share of profits.

## The Debt

Silicon Valley is taking on a huge share of the debt with the assumption that massive new revenues from AI will cover the tab. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Big Tech companies will dish out about $3 trillion on AI infrastructure through 2028, with their own cash flows covering only half of that.

“If the market for artificial intelligence were even to steady in its growth, pretty quickly we will have over-built capacity, and the debt will be worthless, and the financial institutions will lose money,” Luria said.

He further said, “If we get to the point after spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers that we don't need a few years from now, then we're talking about another financial crisis.”

## Too Much Debt

Furthermore, the investment in data centers brings on a new layer of challenges. AI is complicated and needs information stored in data centers to function. These centers are extremely expensive, each costing billions and reliant on loans and shared investment between companies like Meta and the center’s infrastructure.

More importantly, AI doesn’t generate revenue. That is, it doesn’t create profit. OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT and one of the faces of the industry, burns through $14.5 billion each year.

Sam Altman has assured investors that the revenue will be generated in the future — but how? With the billions being invested in it, what could possibly make up the amount of money being spent each year on AI? And more importantly, at what cost? The environment? The people?

Money doesn’t come from thin air. There is a price. Always.

## A Circular Economy

Companies like OpenAI, Nvidia and Palantir are three AI companies currently dominating the market that are examples of a concerning trend. They invest into each other using each other’s money.

They are building a financial structure where investment, infrastructure and demand circulate in a tightly held loop. Each deal ties one player to another, blurring the lines between customer, supplier and partner. At some point, it becomes difficult to tell whether the growth they have is organic — the result of their own development — or the result of this financial structure they created.

Billions are being invested by each company into one another, and it's not just these three that are doing it. Microsoft, Amazon and AMD are also following the same trend, raising concerns about “circular financing.” This has not gone unnoticed amongst investors, with Microsoft seeing a 12% drop in stock after announcing that OpenAI backed 45% of their cloud revenue backlogs.

## The Broader Economy

Harvard Economics said that without the role of AI, the economy grew by a mere 0.5% in the first half of 2025. If that number is true, the only thing preventing a recession right now is the money flowing between AI-focused companies.

Outside of the AI bubble, however, the economy is struggling severely — mostly remaining stagnant.

Economic loss of employment is a major issue within the economy as of now, with 7.4 million people unemployed as of January 2026. In a consumer economy, this is an extremely poor situation to be in. When people lose jobs, they become financially insecure and lose incentive to buy anything, making markets weaker. As prices rise and wages remain low, purchasing power — or the value of a currency — drops significantly.

## Power and Policy

Seven major companies are propping up the US stock market. One of the only reasons a recession hasn’t happened yet is because the top 10% of earners make up 50% of consumer spending.

Wealth inequality has risen drastically post-pandemic, and the rich get richer while the poor get poorer, with many comparing it to pre–French Revolutionary standards.

Donald Trump, the President of the United States and a billionaire himself, has removed AI regulations, given tax and legal exemptions, and only considers the consequences if his authority or the economy is hurt.

Thirty-seven states granted tax exemptions to tech companies. AI policy has been added to the national policy framework, and multiple domains of research, surveillance and international policy have been led by the interest in AI — which Trump benefits from directly because of his close ties with the tech industry.

## Where This Leaves Us

When these poorly thought-out policies for short-term gain eventually fail, normal people pay the price. Similarly to the 2008 bubble, there is a strong likelihood that the government may bail out those responsible when the economy does crash, and ordinary people may be forgotten again.

It’s times like these that create a call for action. The biggest lie told to the people is that they don’t have any agency in the economic market.

As consumers, we must change our view of AI and understand the impact it has. We must use our political leverage to demand action and invest more in ventures of community-based economics instead of relying on big companies that manage themselves irresponsibly for the sake of profit.

Class consciousness needs to awaken now more than ever, and we must remain true to the facts and maintain hope — doing our part in stopping climate change and building a better future.

Markets are unpredictable, and where they go from here is difficult to tell. But understanding them, noticing trends, and recognizing our role and impact can help bring positive change — which we need now more than ever.
