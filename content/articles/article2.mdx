# Convenience and Control

<Blockquote author="Aldous Huxley">
  People will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their ability to think.
</Blockquote>

Never in the history of humanity has everything ever been so easy. Never have we had everything and anything our hearts could desire. Never was convenience more of an option. And this should be good. We have made our lives easier, and have accessed more ease than ever before. But, if everything's brilliant, why is no one happy?

Convenience is the most relevant word to describe our times. We have access to the best media, the most connected people and the most solutions to our problems. We can work from home, we can buy groceries at home, we can socialize at home and we can be entertained at home. All we could ever want — the most trendy clothes, the most intricate jewellery and the coolest aesthetics we have dreamed of — are all in our reach. No one has questioned this. Everyone enjoys the act of clicking the buy button, not having to see the money — expendable enough — be spent on an item we felt dopamine fill our senses seeing.

Yet, emptiness is the most common feeling of this age. Fear, the runner-up. We are constantly hearing complaints of the current state of our world. War. Inequality. Exploitation. Abuse. Corruption.

The age of information has left us with many traits, but unawareness is not one of them. We are all, on some level, aware of the fact that the system we are currently part of is deeply flawed. That it is rotting and the people leading it wearing masks — using loud words and promises echoing out of their mouths while they sneer at us in the offices we elected them into. The question stands:

> "Why have we ended up living in a world we all chose, but that nobody seems to want?"

To understand the answer to this deeply muddled question, we have to look at its deeply muddled origins.

## The Paradox of Control

Hartmut Rosa, a German sociologist, writes of the phenomenon of the modern world in his book, *The Uncontrollability of the World*. He brings to light the modern pursuit of perfection and efficiency started by the second industrial revolution. He writes:

> "Everything that appears to us must be known, mastered, conquered, made useful."

Yet, a paradox emerges. The more we try to control the world, the more we lose control of it.

In some sense, existence alone becomes aggressive as we gut everything to witness its bloodflow — to understand it and master it — yet when we tear it open there is no life. Just the crimson spilt and confusion clouding us as we wonder why it is dead and why we feel guilty.

Rosa further articulates:

> "The experience of feeling alive and of truly encountering the world — that which makes resonance possible — always seems to elude us."

In the process of trying to make our lives easier, we got rid of the most meaningful parts. We became slaves of the ever-growing checklist of efficiency and comfort and consequently lost the things that challenge us and make us grow.

## The Isolation of Convenience

A look at the internet further reflects this trend. We have UberEats instead of going out to eat, Goodreads instead of book clubs, and Instagram instead of human connection. It overwhelms us, leaving us distorted and numb to the world we live in. More important to notice is that all these platforms share one thing in common: **they isolate us.**

It's important to also note that platforms like UberEats have been convicted of illegal business practices which are unethical and exploitative. Yet, there were no large-scale repercussions for these companies, as we as a populace fail to hold them accountable — addicted as we are to the easiness of everything. We end up feeling hopeless as we become more and more incapable of doing the many tasks necessary for not just survival, but a good quality of life.

A lot of the technology created, for starters, doesn't really achieve anything. The presence of AI in every single technological activity — unnecessary yet advertised as revolutionary — is simply to maintain the institutional status quo of the modern world: that it must be dynamic or it will stabilize and fall apart.

Isolation is a friend to all and a friend to none. For the sake of convenience, social gatherings and connections become superficial as current technology gives a replacement to it all, without the inconvenience of complex people with complex emotions. While tools like ChatGPT can feel like the sort of connection many crave, it's programmed to make you feel that way — and the hollowness felt despite all the chat histories proves it.

We know the internet is addictive and we know it's mostly bad for us. While there certainly are benefits to it, the lack of any regulation means that while we become addicted and weak, we are taken advantage of as we can no longer think.

## Surveillance and the Architecture of Control

This extends into a much greater threat: the threat of surveillance and authoritarianism.

Post 9/11, the US government and the country itself was left feeling vulnerable and unsafe. The tragedy rocked the nation and set the foundation for the current trends which grow more and more extreme. While the concept of surveillance in the US isn't a foreign one — with the general population being somewhat aware of how companies steal our data — the truth is much more concerning and organized.

**Palantir** is an AI-surveillance company started with the help of CIA investments and named after the Lord of the Rings all-seeing stones. It almost sounds like a conspiracy theory when you first hear of it. Yet, it is extremely prevalent in our lives and uses AI to recognize patterns and maintain records over the population. It plays an active role in the intelligence department, most recently in the activities of ICE in the country.

Palantir's software now underpins:

- Immigration enforcement operations
- Predictive policing initiatives
- Inter-agency intelligence-sharing systems

While the tools promise enhanced security and operational efficiency, they also raise urgent ethical and legal questions. Critics warn that Palantir's systems do not just track threats — they enable **"deportation by algorithm,"** sweeping up thousands of ordinary people with little transparency or due process.

There is very little consent in this process and the majority of the population feels very strongly about this:

- **81%** of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits.
- **66%** say the same about government data collection.
- **63%** of Americans say they understand very little or nothing at all about the laws and regulations protecting their data privacy.

There has been no consideration by companies or the government on the matter. Simply collaboration.

In fact, while the general population grew alarmed or apathetic to these developments, Palantir considered implementing **predictive policing** — looking at people's histories and details of their lives, predicting who was most likely to commit a crime. The government itself attempted a policy that linked federal databases across agencies — including IRS filings, Social Security data, and immigration records — into a unified system. Not for organization and order, but for control.

## The Warning We Keep Ignoring

Books like *Fahrenheit 451* have warned us of the danger of compliance. The antagonist of the book — who is pro-authoritarian, anti-book, and pro-surveillance — is directly aided by the apathetic society he inhabits. The famous question in the book cuts to the heart of it:

> "How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?"

In World War II, more Jewish people died in the Netherlands than in France. The reason? The Dutch kept better records. It was easier to find them there.

Dystopian books are written as a warning for the possible future. Let us take them seriously.

## What It Means to Be Human

There is a deep sense of dissatisfaction within us as we eliminate the struggle of things — the journey of it. Life was not meant to be conquered; it was meant to be lived. We have cheapened our lives by trying to eliminate suffering at all, as if such a thing was ever possible.

But we are human. It is beautiful. It is painful. But most importantly, it is real. AI appears in front of us as a shortcut, a way out — almost like a drug. Yet, somewhat innately, there is a layer of mistrust and disgust even when we use it, because the idea of something erasing the chapters of our lives — in whatever form it may be, for convenience or safety — *feels wrong.*

Because no matter how empty we feel, we are still searching. Because on some level, we love life. Innately, completely, and disturbingly, we do — through all the pain we may experience, we still search for ways to live it.

I can think of no better way to state this than to quote Mary Shelley, the mother of sci-fi, who could not have imagined how true the sentiment was when in *Frankenstein* she writes:

<Blockquote author="Mary Shelley, Frankenstein">
  Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.
</Blockquote>
